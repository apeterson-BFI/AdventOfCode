Advent of Code daily puzzles

2018 & 2019 years

(I mislabeled my code projects, by calling 2019 2020.)

In 2018, I tried to write most of the days in F#, but ended up creating a CSharp project for some of the harder, less functional puzzles.
I got through the first 14 days before I got stuck and couln't proceed.

This year, in 2019, I'm writing in c#, my best language, trying to go full speed ahead and make it through 25 days.
I'm also not trying to write code at Midnight, because that was a frustrating prospect.
